## BMS ACCESS SUPPORT EXPERIENCE ##


### Best Practices ###
* Use lots of comments and documentation
* Keep your tabs lined up correctly
* Follow HTML5 element heirarchy
* Double check your title tags and favicon
* Store your local project in a regular folder with no cloud syncing - this can cause issues with running/building the project

### Initialize ###
* Use Node v16.13.0 - you can just run "npm run nvm" to set
* run 'npm install'
* run 'npm run dev' (start and serve commands are the same as this by default, customize them if you need to)

### Initial Server Deploy ###


### Update Test/Staging Server ###
This site uses Netlify's auto-deploy functions.  Every time you push to your main branch, Netlify will do a new deploy.

### Form Configuration ###


#### Page Links ####
* http://localhost:3000/ - Index/Home
* http://localhost:3000/posts - Blog posts directory
* http://localhost:3000/posts/master-post - Post master template
* http://localhost:3000/events - This is a clone of the blog pages and functionality, and can be renamed to whatever you need, or just ignored/removed.
